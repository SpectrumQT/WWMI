[ResourceCBFont]
; Note that this font has the size of each character embedded in the unused
; space of the final character, which the geometry shader uses to render each
; character the correct width. This font was generated with gen_bm_font.py,
; then converted to DDS (because our PNG loading seems to be broken o_O):
filename = Fonts/LiberationSans-Bold.dds

[CustomShaderDebugCB]
; The vertex shader passes constant buffer indexes to the geometry shader:
vs = Shaders/debug_cb.hlsl
hs = null
ds = null
; The geometry shader generates the text for a given constant buffer index:
gs = Shaders/debug_cb.hlsl
; The pixel shader draws the font:
ps = Shaders/debug_cb.hlsl
; Disable compiler optimisations to save 1.5 seconds every F10. The shader
; becomes significantly larger and potentially slower, but that doesn't matter
; since it is a debugging shader:
flags = skip_optimization
; Allows us to use SV_Position.z to pack a texcoord, increasing the character
; limit per geometry shader invocation:
depth_clip_enable = false
cull = none
; Enable alpha blending. To change the text colour, edit the pixel shader:
blend = add one inv_src_alpha
; Use points as the primitive from the vertex shader to the geometry shader:
topology = point_list
run = BuiltInCommandListUnbindAllRenderTargets
o0 = set_viewport no_view_cache bb
; Pass the constant buffer to view into the geometry shader:
gs-cb13 = ResourceCB
gs-t113 = ResourceBuf
gs-t114 = ResourceBufUint
; raw forces raw access in cases where the buffer supports either way:
gs-t115 = raw ResourceBufRaw
; x is used by the shader to check if anything is bound to the cb13 slot (t113
; is checked with GetDimensions):
local $bak_x = x
local $bak_y = y
local $bak_z = z
local $bak_w = w
x = rt_width
y = rt_height
z = gs-cb13
; Set w to 0 in case this is an old 3DMigoto without effective_dpi support
w = 0
w = 0
; Font is passed into the pixel shader (to draw it) *and* the geometry shader
; (as the character sizes are encoded in the final character of the font):
gs-t100 = ResourceCBFont
ps-t100 = ResourceCBFont
; Change this number to set how many entries are drawn:
draw = 4096, 0
; I didn't back these up because I doubt they will be in use and this shader
; won't be enabled in production, but it's still good practice to clear them:
post gs-cb13 = null
post gs-t113 = null
post gs-t114 = null
post gs-t115 = null
post gs-t100 = null
post ps-t100 = null
post x = $bak_x
post y = $bak_y
post z = $bak_z
post w = $bak_w
